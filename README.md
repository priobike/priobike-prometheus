## What else to know

### ⚠️ Don't merge `main`/`stable`/`release` branch ⚠️

Similiar to our [priobike-deployment-docker](https://github.com/priobike/priobike-deployment-docker) repo, those branches include deployment specific differences and are diverging on purpose.

## Contributing

We highly encourage you to open an issue or a pull request. You can also use our repository freely with the `MIT` license. 

Every service runs through testing before it is deployed in our release setup. Read more in our [PrioBike deployment readme](https://github.com/priobike/.github/blob/main/wiki/deployment.md) to understand how specific branches/tags are deployed.
